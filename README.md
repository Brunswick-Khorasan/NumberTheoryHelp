# NumberTheoryHelp
Repository of Python scripts that have helped me with number theory problems

Currently includes implementations of
- Chinese Remainder Theorem
- Pollard's rho algorithm
- Miller-Rabin Primality test

Note: These aren't necessarily fast or efficient, since they follow the letter of the test and/or algorithm without making optimizations
